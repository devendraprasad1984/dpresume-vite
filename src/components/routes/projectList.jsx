        <p>Built on Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) as backbone for the site, this project transforms legacy
          site. The legacy site is on WordPress and has scalability/multi tenancy concerns. Using AEM, the
          framework itself gives multi-tenant and multi-lingual support for site management. We are using core
          html/JavaScript and React18 for frontend development, using storybook as a tool to test our
          components.
